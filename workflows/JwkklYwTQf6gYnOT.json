I changed the file to add the UI to the stack and now I am staring at a \"Generating BunkerWeb config file\" since yesterday. I also added this [https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) from the Web UI manual on the BunkerWeb page.

I've been using this to protect some of my services which I don't want exposed to the general public, but still want to access (when sometimes I may not have the ability to VPN into my network). Things like Sonarr/Radarr, and also a few other things - despite them having logins of their own, I wanted another layer of security.\n\nI feel I'm doing this wrong and there's a better solutions, but I just don't know what that is.\n\nHere's the layout...  \n\n- My own domains  \n- DNS through Cloudflare  \n- Port 80 &amp; 443 port forwards on firewall to reverse proxy  \n- Various services then hosted on a handful of VMs/etc internally on my trust lan.   \n- Want to access these things from the same subnet via hostname (ie: https://service1.myname.com, https://service2.myname.com, etc, etc) but when external, I want some of them to selectively have an additional layer of security.  \n\nI know there must be a best practice here, but I'm simply missing it. I'd really prefer not to have to VPN in (tailscale, wireguard, etc) as I may not have access to using a client in some cases, and be on a friend's computer, etc. For example, my \"todo\" list on Vikunja, I'd prefer not to have it exposed directly to the Internet, but behind a secondary login before I get to the primary login screen for that service.\n\nI've yet to really play with other reverse proxies such as Traefik / Caddy / etc, but have also considered using some sort of a WAF for this, as well. BunkerWeb is interesting, but I'm a little cheesed at the lack of LetsEncrypt certificates being part of it.\n\nLooking for some suggestions from the community, perhaps there's something I've drastically overlooked. \n\nThank you.","permalink":"/r/homelab/comments/1hv4z91/reverse_proxy_with_protection_a_question/","subreddit":"homelab","thumbnail":"","author":"ilovedillpickles","created_utc":1736185750,"over_18":false}},{"json":{"id":"1ervt6e","title":"confusion about Nextcloud AIO revers proxy mode","body":"so i try to setup a Nextcloud AIO, docker compose files are running fine and i get a webpage of Nextclound in ip:8080 on local network.\n\ngot the passphrase thing as well and im on the page where i get to insert the domain name\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0d93lwy3lid1.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db06c047eb2bbde5c9794145534dbbe71715d4ce\n\nthat [NCsite.example.com](http://NCsite.example.com) (well the true domain, not example) has valid A record attached. on firewall the 443 is connected to PFsence internal HAproxy that manages certificates and backend is connected to httpd server and i get a \"it works message\". so the piping is ok.\n\nbut im failing to understand why it does not work for this AIO setup. right now i have not set the AIO IP to the backend config, as i dont want the setup part to be exposed to the public network. also setup talks about 443 but right now im on 8080, so what does it want me to connect on that part? and as im already using valid lets encrypt cert on that https connection, why does Nextcloud want to do anything whit it? its already there.\n\nim failing to understand this \"logic\" here..\n\nend result would be connection to HAproxy &gt; bunkerweb WAF &gt; nextcloud server. but all i can see is nextcloud does not like that idea.","permalink":"/r/NextCloud/comments/1ervt6e/confusion_about_nextcloud_aio_revers_proxy_mode/","subreddit":"NextCloud","thumbnail":"","author":"Larnork","created_utc":1723621961,"over_18":false}},{"json":{"id":"1fxaq0c","title":"Engine activity","body":"What is the meaning of the \"*Last viewed*\", \"*Last status sync*\" and \"*Last signal sync*\" times in the console?
